- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - Lightweight database to store student records.
- [Google Generative AI](https://developers.google.com/generative-ai) - To generate SQL queries from text input.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Programming language used to build the application.
- [Regex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) - For cleaning generated SQL queries.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-query-generator.git
   cd sql-query-generator
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Google API key:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Input your question in the text box and click the "Ask the question" button. The app will generate an SQL query based on your input and execute it against the database, displaying the results.

## Example Queries

Here are some example questions you can ask:

- "How many entries of records are present?"
- "Tell me all the students studying in Data Science class?"
- "What is the average marks of students?"

## Database Schema

The database **student.db** has the following schema:

| Column  | Type    | Description                          |
|---------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| NAME    | VARCHAR(25) | Name of the student                  |
| CLASS   | VARCHAR(25) | Class of the student                 |
| SECTION | VARCHAR(25) | Section of the student               |
| MARKS   | INT     | Marks obtained by the student        |
